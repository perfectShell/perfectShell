<h2>What is this about?</h2>
In Perfect Shell you are playing as a professional Fixer, just another pixel trying to survive and maybe even live comfortably in the nameless city you call your home. Technology is far advanced, cybernetic enhanced bodies, software directly plugable into the brain, all wonders of the past. Now that is just another generic necessity in your daily life, like boots to walk, like a phone to check your messages.

As the story unfolds you are forced to give up on most of your human body and you will have to rapidly adapt to a new, ever-changing environment, if you want to have any hope at all of reclaiming what you lost, maybe even restoring yourself to your lost humanity. If you want to, that is.


The tools of your trade are manifold, from infiltration, relying on your new robotic body upgraded with a lightweight chassis and equiped with state-of-the-art hacking software and programmed with the best burglary-software, to outwitting your opponents skillfully in social interactions, relying on combat and the edge an upgraded military-grade body-platform gives you to the most simple but maybe also the most enjoyable option in your arsenal, seducing your foes with the wonders only a gynoid with replaceable and detachable bodyparts can offer.

The choice is yours alone.

<h2>How you do it?</h2>
This website: The files are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/perfectShell/perfectShell), the building framework is [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), this theme is a slighty customized variant of [After-Dark](https://git.habd.as/comfusion/after-dark/) and for the actual online-aviability I'm using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

The game: Twine2 Engine Ver. 2.21, SugarCube2 Format Ver. 2.26, for the pixel-art Aseprite 1.9 self-compiled and Atom as an editor, cause the Twine inbuild-one sucks gay hairy ass.

The story: Created on the basis of an inherently dark humour and lots of alcohol, specifically Dark Beer and the occasionally Spirit. Also I'm bored af and this is fun.
