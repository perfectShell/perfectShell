For now the version you are seeing is just a demo, titled "Workshop Version". For all intents and purposes, this is designed to give you an introduction into the main-aspect of this game, designing your own robotic cybertech-body.

This game will be heavily story-centered, "coming soon"(TM). For more info take a look at [Where am I?](/faq).

Yes, the art is still wonky, tits look like shit and I'm pretty sure the equipment system is containig one or five bugs.
But hey, it's something and I'm planning on getting to work on those things asap, especially art-improvements!
Take a look at the [Roadmap](/roadmap).
