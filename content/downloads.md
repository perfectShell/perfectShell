You can download the latest stable version from MEGA.nz or a bleeding edge version from the Git-Repo of this site. The "Play Online" version will also be bleeding edge.
The reason being if I do small consecutive updates in short order, like 5 small art-asset changes in a day I don't want to reupload the MEGA archive every time.

+ STABLE on Mega.nz:
	+ [Stable - Version 0.1.0](https://mega.nz/#!u6BgTaaT!IU3QKG8h6MY8BdyJBBONsTarhkrB3ma0hLsAWdq2MOU)

LATEST on Git: [Here](https://github.com/perfectShell/perfectShell/static/play)
